Warning : GCC 4.2+ is not yet supported. Thanks to the new pointers over/underflows limitations 
introduced with that version ! Memtest86+ compiled with GCC 4.2+ will result in a non-working 
binary (hangs in the first seconds). We're working on a fix but there is really many parts of
the code to check & change everywhere. So, please use GCC 4.1 instead.
